I just bought a new laptop, [ASUS ZenBook S16](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606/). This is intended to be my backup workstation in case my main computer gets broken or I'm traveling and somehow need to work.

# Why did I choose this laptop
Honestly, it's because I got a neat deal in my local online store ([Blibli](https://www.blibli.com/)), around IDR 24 million / USD 1,493 at the time I bought it. So, it's not purely because I really like or want this laptop. I did, however, spend time researching this laptop before I bought it.

# What's the spec
Here is the quick specification:

- **CPU**: [AMD Ryzen AI 9 370 HX](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-370.html)
- **GPU**: AMD Radeon 890M
- **RAM**: 32 GB LPDDR5X
- **Storage**: 1 TB NVME SSD
- **Display**: 16 inch, 3K (2880 x 1800), OLED, 120 Hz
- **Battery**: 78 Wh

And here are other details about the laptop:
- Unique material for the chassis — ASUS calls it "Ceraluminum", a portmanteau of "Ceramic" and "Aluminum". It feels like the surface of paper on metal.
- 1.5 kg — Honestly, I never had a 16" laptop before, so I can't make comparisons. But my current opinion is the laptop feels quite lightweight.
- Features [NPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_processing_unit) — which ASUS claims has 50 TOPS of power. A new processing unit inside the CPU intended to assist operations related to local AI inference.
- HDMI port, 1 USB-A 3.2 port, 2 USB-C ports, SD card slot, 3.5 mm headphone jack
- No NumPad

# What I like
- Beautiful, large screen — really helpful for coding. This is the first time I'm using a screen that has more refresh rate than 60 Hz. The first moment I saw the screen of this laptop was the same as when I first saw a game playing in 60fps. This also ruined me in a way; I think I will have difficulties going back to 60 Hz from now.
- Great performance — lowkey what drew me to buy this laptop for its price. More than capable of covering my working tasks which mostly consist of: compiling and managing containers using Docker, transpiling JS, playing video in a web browser, and transcoding video files.
- Pretty, simple aesthetics — slightly resembles Apple MacBook 16 if the stickers are removed
- Quiet fan
- Keyboard is nice to type — feels like my old Apple MacBook Pro Retina 2015
- SD card slot is helpful for me, who often needs to transfer between my mobile devices (phone, camera, handheld consoles)

# What I don't like
- It gets severely hot under heavy load — however, the hotspot is quite far from the keyboard, on top of the function keys, so it's not that annoying when working
- Battery is not that great — I can get around 5 hours under normal workload
- The OLED screen is so glossy — makes it difficult to see in a well-lit area.

# What I think is interesting
- The Ryzen AI NPU on this laptop makes me curious and gets me interested in the topic. There are some [resources by AMD for developers](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/ryzen-ai-software.html) to run local AI inferences of some models on the NPU. I think I may experiment a bit in the future, comparing it to both CPU and GPU inferences.

# Overall
I think I'm happy with the laptop, especially considering the price I paid for it. At the time I bought it, there were no other laptops that offered the same internal specs and features at the same price.

I plan to use this laptop for a minimum of 5 years before replacing it, just like my old Apple MacBook Retina.
