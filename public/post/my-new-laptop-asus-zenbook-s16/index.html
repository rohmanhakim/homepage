</div>

<main>
<p>I just bought a new laptop, <a href="https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606/">ASUS ZenBook S16</a>. This is intended to be my backup workstation in case my main computer gets broken or I&rsquo;m traveling and somehow need to work.</p>
<h1 id="why-did-i-choose-this-laptop">Why did I choose this laptop</h1>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s because I got a neat deal in my local online store (<a href="https://www.blibli.com/">Blibli</a>), around IDR 24 million / USD 1,493 at the time I bought it. So, it&rsquo;s not purely because I really like or want this laptop. I did, however, spend time researching this laptop before I bought it.</p>
<h1 id="whats-the-spec">What&rsquo;s the spec</h1>
<p>Here is the quick specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU</strong>: <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-370.html">AMD Ryzen AI 9 370 HX</a></li>
<li><strong>GPU</strong>: AMD Radeon 890M</li>
<li><strong>RAM</strong>: 32 GB LPDDR5X</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 1 TB NVME SSD</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong>: 16 inch, 3K (2880 x 1800), OLED, 120 Hz</li>
<li><strong>Battery</strong>: 78 Wh</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read the benchmark for this laptop on these websites:</p>

</ul>
<p>And here are other details about the laptop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique material for the chassis — ASUS calls it &ldquo;Ceraluminum&rdquo;, a portmanteau of &ldquo;Ceramic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aluminum&rdquo;. It feels like the surface of paper on metal.</li>
<li>1.5 kg — Honestly, I never had a 16&quot; laptop before, so I can&rsquo;t make comparisons. But my current opinion is the laptop feels quite lightweight.</li>
<li>Features <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_processing_unit">NPU</a> — which ASUS claims has 50 TOPS of power. A new processing unit inside the CPU intended to assist operations related to local AI inference.</li>
<li>HDMI port, 1 USB-A 3.2 port, 2 USB-C ports, SD card slot, 3.5 mm headphone jack</li>
<li>No NumPad</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-i-like">What I like</h1>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful, large screen — really helpful for coding. This is the first time I&rsquo;m using a screen that has more refresh rate than 60 Hz. The first moment I saw the screen of this laptop was the same as when I first saw a game playing in 60fps. This also ruined me in a way; I think I will have difficulties going back to 60 Hz from now.</li>
<li>Great performance — lowkey what drew me to buy this laptop for its price. More than capable of covering my working tasks which mostly consist of: compiling and managing containers using Docker, transpiling JS, playing video in a web browser, and transcoding video files.</li>
<li>Pretty, simple aesthetics — slightly resembles Apple MacBook 16 if the stickers are removed</li>
<li>Quiet fan</li>
<li>Keyboard is nice to type — feels like my old Apple MacBook Pro Retina 2015</li>
<li>SD card slot is helpful for me, who often needs to transfer between my mobile devices (phone, camera, handheld consoles)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-i-dont-like">What I don&rsquo;t like</h1>
<ul>
<li>It gets severely hot under heavy load — however, the hotspot is quite far from the keyboard, on top of the function keys, so it&rsquo;s not that annoying when working</li>
<li>Battery is not that great — I can get around 5 hours under normal workload</li>
<li>The OLED screen is so glossy — makes it difficult to see in a well-lit area.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-i-think-is-interesting">What I think is interesting</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Ryzen AI NPU on this laptop makes me curious and gets me interested in the topic. There are some <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/ryzen-ai-software.html">resources by AMD for developers</a> to run local AI inferences of some models on the NPU. I think I may experiment a bit in the future, comparing it to both CPU and GPU inferences.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="overall">Overall</h1>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m happy with the laptop, especially considering the price I paid for it. At the time I bought it, there were no other laptops that offered the same internal specs and features at the same price.</p>
<p>I plan to use this laptop for a minimum of 5 years before replacing it, just like my old Apple MacBook Retina.</p>
